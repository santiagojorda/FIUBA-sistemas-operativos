 * cmd
 * ---

 *  - type: { EXEC, REDIR, BACK, PIPE }
 *  - pid: the process id
 *  - scmd: a string representing the command before being parsed

 * execcmd
 * -------
 *
 * It contains all the relevant information to execute a command.
 *
 *  - type: could be EXEC or REDIR
 *  - argc: arguments quantity after parsed
 *  - argv: array of strings representig the arguments
 *          of the form: { "binary/command", "arg0", "arg1", ... , (char*) NULL }
 *  - eargc: environ vars quantity after parsed
 *  - eargv: array of strings of the form: "KEY=VALUE"
 *          representing the environ vars
 *  - *_file: string that contains the name of the file to be redirected to
 *
 *  IMPORTANT
 *  ---------
 *      An execcmd struct can have EXEC or REDIR type depending on if the command
 *      to be executed has at least one redirection symbol (<, >, >>, >&)
